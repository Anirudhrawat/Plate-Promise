        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <br>
        <p>We are an NGO that makes a promise to the deprived ones a plate of food. Hence, the name "PlatePromise".
          At PlatePromise, we believe in making a difference, one meal at a time. Our mission is simple yet profound: to bridge the gap between food surplus and food insecurity. With the support of generous donors like you, we collect surplus food from various sources and redistribute it to those in need. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Every donation, whether big or small, contributes to nourishing our communities and alleviating hunger among the less fortunate. Through our dedicated efforts, we strive to ensure that no one goes to bed hungry.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Join us in our journey to create a world where food is not wasted but shared with compassion and care.
